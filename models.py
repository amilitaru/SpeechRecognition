  There are many possible ways of deriving predictions from a spectrogram

  kinds of models in a black-box way. You need to pass in a TensorFlow node as
  the 'fingerprint' input, and this should output a batch of 1D features that
  describe the audio. Typically this will be derived from a spectrogram that's
  been run through an MFCC, but in theory it can be any feature vector of the
  size specified in model_settings['fingerprint_size'].

  The function will build the graph it needs in the current TensorFlow graph,
  and return the tensorflow output that will contain the 'logits' input to the
  softmax prediction process. If training flag is on, it will also return a
  placeholder node that can be used to control the dropout amount.

  'Convolutional Neural Networks for Small-footprint Keyword Spotting' paper:
  http://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2015/papers/i15_1478.pdf

  Here's the layout of the graph:

  This produces fairly good quality results, but can involve a large number of
  weight parameters and computations. For a cheaper alternative from the same
  paper with slightly less accuracy, see 'low_latency_conv' below.

  During training, dropout nodes are introduced after each relu, controlled by a
  placeholder.

  Args:
    fingerprint_input: TensorFlow node that will output audio feature vectors.
    model_settings: Dictionary of information about the model.
    is_training: Whether the model is going to be used for training.

  Returns:
    TensorFlow node outputting logits results, and optionally a dropout
    placeholder.
